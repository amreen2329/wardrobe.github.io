            Fitted wardrobes are made to measure. This means you can get
            wardrobes that fit effortlessly into the space in question, giving
            your room a seamless finish. It also means you can utilise any
            unused nooks and crannies about your house.

        <h2 class="heading">Benefits of Fitted Wardrobes</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The beauty of built-in wardrobes (or any fitted bedroom furniture,
            for that matter!) is they can be tailored to suit your space. With
            freestanding wardrobes, you are often restricted in where you can
            place them. Their dimensions are fixed and will only allow you to
            use them in certain corners or under ceilings of a particular
            height.

      <p>Do fitted wardrobes add value to home?</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            While in-built wardrobes are an investment, they can improve the
            value of your house by optimising storage space, which is of great
            interest to many potential buyers. It is recommended you only invest
            in high-quality, built-in bedroom furniture, as this will help to
            keep your interior looking cohesive and enticing.
